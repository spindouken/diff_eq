# Interactive Simulation Dashboard

An interactive web application for visualizing ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems, including the Lorenz attractor and Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

- Real-time ODE simulation using RK4 solver
- Interactive parameter controls
- 2D and 3D phase-space visualizations
- Time-series plots
- Multiple dynamical systems (Lorenz, Lotka-Volterra)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript
- Plotly.js for visualizations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
